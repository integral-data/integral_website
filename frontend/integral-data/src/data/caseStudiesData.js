        title: "Revamping Retention Metrics for a Health Sharing Company",
        subheader: "Moving from Persistency to Attrition Metrics",
        author: "Jeff Barton",
        datePosted: "2023-06-15",
        content: `## The Problem
        \n\nOur client, a **health sharing company**, was struggling to accurately gauge member retention. 
        They had been using a metric called _Persistency_, which calculated as the division of current members over all-time member counts. 
        However, this metric was proving to be misleading and less informative for the company's specific needs. \n\n## The Solution\n\n We 
        proposed to shift from persistency to attrition metrics. The idea was to measure the percentage of customers who stayed for _90_, _180_, and _365_ days. This approach, we believed, could provide a more realistic view of customer retention.\n\nTo demonstrate the value of this new approach, we mocked up a Jupyter Notebook with some dummy data. The aim was to show that persistency as a metric could decrease over time, thus creating potentially misleading interpretations. In contrast, attrition allows for a more accurate assessment of customer retention at various time periods.\n\n## The Result\n\nThe new attrition metrics were significantly more insightful for our client. They were not only able to better measure their business but also received a clear demonstration of our capabilities not just as technical experts, but as valuable business partners. The client was extremely pleased with the outcome, reinforcing our belief that the right metrics can make all the difference in business measurement and strategy.`,

        datePosted: "2023-06-20",
        content: `## The Challenge\n\nWe were approached by a **health insurance client** who was overwhelmed by the complexity of data they were receiving from a vendor handling their claims. The vendor supplied them with around _15 CSV files_, some of which boasted _thousands of columns_ and _hundreds of thousands of rows_. Analyzing this data manually was virtually impossible and incredibly time-consuming.\n\n## Our Approach\n\nTo tackle this, we turned to automation. We wrote sophisticated code designed to:\n\n1. Navigate through each file\n2. Determine which columns likely held relevant data\n3. Extract the useful information\n4. Considerably condense each dataset\n\nBy automating the data analysis, we were able to efficiently distill the important information from the dauntingly large CSV files.\n\n## Data Cleaning\n\nIn addition to analyzing and condensing the data, we also ensured it was in perfect shape for their analytics platform. Our code carried out thorough data cleaning operations to eliminate errors, inaccuracies, or inconsistencies that could jeopardize the accuracy of further analysis.\n\n## The Outcome\n\nThe result was a streamlined, clean dataset that our client could immediately plug into their analytics platform. What once was an overwhelming and unwieldy set of CSV files, turned into a reliable foundation for their data-driven decisions. This project reaffirmed our ability to leverage technical expertise to tackle complex business challenges, further strengthening our client's trust in our capabilities.`,

        content: `## The Challenge\n\nWe were approached by a **wealth management client** who faced an extremely tedious and error-prone process for retrieving customer data. Their front-end system held all the necessary client data. However, agents had to manually sift through each customer's data one-by-one â€“ a formidable task considering they had _thousands of customers_.\n\n## Our Solution\n\nRecognizing the inefficiency and potential for errors in their current process, we proposed the creation of a **web scraping tool**. After receiving approval from the client and vendor, we set to work.\n\nThe tool we developed was designed to:\n\n1. Systematically access the front-end system\n2. Efficiently extract the necessary data\n3. Clean and standardize the data for further use\n\n## The Outcome\n\nThe result was a powerful tool that eliminated the need for manual data retrieval. Agents no longer had to painstakingly navigate through individual client data. Instead, they had all the necessary data at their fingertips, cleaned, standardized, and ready for use.\n\nOur client was thrilled with the time savings and the reliability of the data. This project served as yet another testament to our ability to devise technical solutions to business challenges, significantly improving efficiency and accuracy.`,
